# LLM-application-in-Question-Answering


The LLM Question-Answering Application project is an interface for extracting insights from custom documents using LLM power. Users start by providing their OpenAI API keys and uploading PDFs, DOCX, or TXT files. The application processes, chunks, and embeds content using thLLM model, with embeddings stored in a FAISS vector store. Users can then query the document and receive responses in about a minute, ensuring a seamless and efficient information retrieval experience.
